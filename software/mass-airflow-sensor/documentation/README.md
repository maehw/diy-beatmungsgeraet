# DIY-Beatmungsgerät Mass Air Flow Sensor

The mass air flow sensor has started as part of the "DIY-Beatmungsgerät" project, which itself developed itself from the German hackathon event [#WirvsVirusHackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) in March 2020.

The aim of this repository to provide data to use ready-made mass air flow sensors as well as build and verify DIY mass air flow sensors. The current DIY approach is based on analogue differential pressure sensors.
